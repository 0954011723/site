It's great to hear you'd like to make Hexo more awesome! When modifying files, please keep the following in your mind.

**JavaScript:**

- Follow [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).
- Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.

var fs = require('fs'),

var doSomething = function(callback){
  callback();
};
```


**CSS:**

- Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.
- Put spaces after `:` in property declarations.

#foo
  clearfix()
  color: #444
  background: url("background.png")
```
