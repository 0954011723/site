title: Internationalization (i18n)
---
Hexo has a simple i18n module built-in, which means you can make Hexo says your language!

To enable i18n for Hexo, edit `language` setting. The language code must be written in [IETF format](http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/). For example: Traditional Chinese is `zh-TW`.

``` yaml
language: zh-TW
```

## Structure

``` plain
.
├── default.yml
└── zh-TW.yml
```

All language files must put into `languages` folder and be written in YAML format. All `languages` folder must have `default.yml` at least.

{% note warn YAML format %}
Don't use tabs in language files, use spaces instead. Also, add a space after colons.
{% endnote %}

## i18n in Theme

To use i18n in the theme. Use `__` (double underscores) with the key you set in language files.

``` js
<%= __('key') %>
```

You can even pass more than one arguments:

``` js
<%= __('Hello %s!', 'World') %>
// => Hello World!
```

`%s` in the first string will be replaced with the second string. The result will be `Hello World!`.
