#### Why?

First of all, many people have asked about donation, so here it is!

Second, in all good conscience, the most of the visible costs are covered by us, like the domain name. We also spend a tremendous time to make Hexo running and functioning. This is the real cost and also invisible.

#### Benefits?!

We thank for every penny donations, here is a list of benefits you and us can achieve:

1. Covers our cost.
2. Motivate and admit our work.
3. List your name on Hexo.io website (2.5k users and 10k pageviews per day)!

There are two tiers of donation:
  * Less than $100, your name and website link will be on the donator list.
  * More than $100, your name, icon, and website link will be on the home page for at least one month (depend on the amount).

** Again, thanks for your support! **
